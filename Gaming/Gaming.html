        <h3>WildRift</h3>
        <p>
          My first time playing League of Legend was on the year 2016, hard
          stuck Silver Rank. Wasn't easy to play the game at that time because
          of using Mouse for clicking the minions and hero champs some auto
          attack animation trick cancellation. <br />
          <br />
          Then stopped playing it somewhere around June 2016 because I had to
          move from Jeddah to My Home Country Philippine. Sadly had to sacrifice
          my PC and only Mobile Phone Games will my sanity in check Then i
          discovered Mobile Legend by Moontoon. It's a MOBA genre game similar
          to LoL PC (okay lets face it, it's a copy paste of LoL by chinese
          companies). <br />
          <br />
          Played the game more easily compared to the LoL PC and learnt the
          basics rules of each roles. Am an all rounder player (i can do any
          roles). My highest achievements in ML is getting my rank to Mythical
          III <br />
          <br />
          Then Wildrift has been released on 2020 November. Where i enjoyed the
          game so much not only did i get to experience the LoL Champ again but
          the difficulty Level from ML vs WR is so noticeable and majority of
          the blind folks stating Riot LoL copies ML. Like bruh do you research
          before spouting out nonsense remarks LOL.
